# Octagone
This is a Pong-esque game where the goal is to avoid the balls that will be shot across the screen. The last one standing wins.  
Players connect by using the same IP address that the host has set up.

The game was created in C++ using SFML, as part of my college course. It is being given a GitHub repo for archival purposes.
